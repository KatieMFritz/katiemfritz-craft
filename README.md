## Installation and Version Control

### Local Install

I use [Wamp64](http://download.cnet.com/WampServer-64-Bit/3000-10248_4-75544590.html). I have to run as administrator for it to work properly.

I put the files from Public into the root folder and set `$craftPath = './craft';`.

### Version Control

`.gitignore`
